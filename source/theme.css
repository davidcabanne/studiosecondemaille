 * This is where all of the CSS code is handled for your theme.
 *
 * We recommend you break your CSS into multiple files and put them in a separate
 * directory. We've used a "stylesheets" directory in our example below. After that we'll use
 * Sprockets (getsprockets.org) to package them into one file. Sprockets also allows you to
 * use Sass/SCSS (sass-lang.com) by ending your file name with .sass or .scss, and you can also
 * use LESS (lesscss.org) by ending your file with .less.
 *
 * However, if you don't have much CSS, or you're just a glutton for punishment,
 * you could simply put all of your CSS in this file. It's up to you.
