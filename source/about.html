      <h2>Seconde Maille</h2>
      <p class="sectionParagraph">
        Graduated from the HEAR in Mulhouse, Héloïse is a textile designer who
        knits yarns and cords from dormant stocks of surplus yarns sourced in
        various French spinning mills. The use of deadstock yarn means that
        certain yarns cannot be reordered, so only a limited amount of pieces
        can be made. Pieces are also made to order to reduce the amount of waste
        and surplus stock. Please ask for the delivery time (between 2-3 weeks
        in general).
      </p>
      <p class="sectionParagraph">
        Since earning her Master's degree in Textile, she has devoted her
        creative energy to transforming deadstock ropes into collections of her
        own design of bags and accessories. With a keen eye for innovation and
        sustainability, she seamlessly blends her technical expertise with a
        passion for repurposing materials. Crafted by hand, each unique piece in
        her collections intertwines the artistry of braided ropes, breathing new
        life into overlooked resources and embodying a tale of conscious
        creation.

        Then, she specialized in knitting design by acquiring second-hand
        knitting machines. It is from a hack of electronic 80's knitting machine
        that she converts pixels into stitches. This way she creates patterns
        and shapes to elaborate her collections of handmade accessories.
